## Chickblood is a new artist label form Chengdu, China. 

We’re a bunch of hyperactive kids grew up in different culture backgrounds but we still met each others in China’s underground music scene.

Although now we living in different countries, we’re still share a same spirit. Like the original meaning of Chickblood in Chinese：we’ll stirring up u all instantly. 
Each of us has many identities, It's hard to find the words to quite cover us. Like our profile says, “Just do the things we be keen on”.

## Chickblood是一隻由一群過度興奮的小孩創立的全新藝術家廠牌，來自中國成都。

我們在不同的文化背景裡長大，卻在中國的地下音樂場景裡相識。儘管如今我們身處不同國家，卻共享著相同的信念。就像Chickblood這個名字的中文意思“打雞血”所表達的意思一樣，我們要攪亂這一切，瞬間讓你被我們激活。

每一個我們的成員都有著不同的身分，很難找到可以完美涵蓋我們的詞。也許就像我們的介紹裡所說，“我們只做我們熱衷的”。
